**RPAS_repeatability**

Code for paper Evaluating the repeatability of RPAS surveys to monitor submerged seagrass habitats

Code includes:

Supplementing training data *
Kernel density plots including supplemented training data *
Supervised image classification of orthoimage *
Measure proportion of quadrat coverage *
Compare drone vs snorkel assessment of habitat cover
Zero inflated models of difference in eelgrass estimates - spearate models for drone and snorkel data
Caplin Cove altitude test
Quadrat altitude test
*Example code, using the North Harbour dataset. Same methods were repeated for the other sites/seasons

*** Rasters are too large to upload on GitHub. Code is still uncluded but will not run.
