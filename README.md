**RPAS_repeatability**

Code for paper Evaluating the repeatability of RPAS surveys to monitor submerged seagrass habitats

Code includes:

1) Supplementing training data *
2) Kernel density plots including supplemented training data *
3) Supervised image classification of orthoimage *
4) Measure proportion of quadrat coverage *
5) Compare drone vs snorkel assessment of habitat cover
6) Zero inflated models of difference in eelgrass estimates - spearate models for drone and snorkel data
7) Caplin Cove altitude test
8) Quadrat altitude test

*Example code, using the North Harbour dataset. Same methods were repeated for the other sites/seasons

*** Rasters are too large to upload on GitHub. Code is still uncluded but will not run.
